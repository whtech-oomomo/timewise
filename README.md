# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To create a README that explains how to install and start the whtech-oomomo/timewise project, I’ll assume it’s a standard TypeScript (likely Node.js or frontend) project. If there are special requirements or a specific framework (like React, Vue, Next.js, etc.), let me know for more accuracy.

Here’s a starter README section for installation and getting started:

---

# Timewise

A TypeScript-based project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whtech-oomomo/timewise.git
   cd timewise
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Starting the Project

### Development Mode

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

### Production Build

To build the project for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
or
```bash
yarn build
```

To start the production server:
```bash

## Additional Notes

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (recommended version 16+).
- If you use environment variables, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update as needed.

If you can tell me what framework or stack (e.g., Next.js, React, Express, etc.) this project uses, I’ll tailor the instructions further!
